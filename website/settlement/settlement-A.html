<h1>Settlement A</h1>




<p>
    The Plaintiff and Defendant  will enter into a boundary line and settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) 
    that will <br/> (a) establish the boundary line between the properties in a manner that does not result in any encroachments; 
    <br/>  (b) provide terms for the parties’ conduct in the event of demolition or construction on either property; 
</p>

<p>       
    The Settlement Agreement will provide that both parties will agree to abide by all construction codes in the
    process of demolition and future development of their respective properties and will take due care to ensure that 
    their proposed construction/demolition plans will not result in damage to the other property. 
    The parties will each be responsible for any damages caused to the other property as a result of their respective demolition 
    or construction activities.

<p>   
    The Settlement Agreement will provide that both property owners shall be permited to building up along the shared property line in the future.  
</p>


</p>   
    The Settlement Agreement will provide that Owner of Lot 3 Block 202 will agree that the existing windows on the building at 641 Arnold Avenue 
    which are along the shared property line shall not restrict Lot 2 Block 202 from building up  along the shared property line
    in the future. 
</p>

<p>
    The Settlement Agreement will provide that Owner of Lot 3 Block 202 agrees that the existing windows on the building at
    Lot 3 Block 202 which are along the shared property line will be removed at Owners expense.

<p>
    The Settlement Agreement will provide that, in the event that construction occurs along the shared property line, 
    the parties will agree to work with one another on a mutually agreeable timeline to perform any maintenance 
    and/or construction on the exterior walls of the buildings.
