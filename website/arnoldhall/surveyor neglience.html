	<p>
    From 110 year (1906-2016), there were zero discrepancy regarding the boundary line between property 
    owners of Lot 2 and Lot 3 of Block 202 of Point Pleasant of Beach. During that time, we currently know
    of 5 different surveys that all indicated the building on Lot 3 encroaches Lot 2.  
    Those surveys were commissioned by multiple parties including both property owners and 
    multiple potential buyers of both properties.  The surveys were performed by various different 
    Surveyors for various different parties and reasons.   Exhibits:

    In 2017, this changed when the Real Estate Broker Joe Carannante went under contract to purchase the property with the dirty title. 
	Joe Carannante, his attorney Adam Steuerman, and their surveyor devised a scheme to clean the title of the encroachment by creating a cloud of 
	uncertainty regarding the boundary line and then attempting to use the courts to redraw the property line in their favor. </p>

	<h2>David J. Von Steenburg of Morgan Engineering & Surveying</h1>  
    <p>Morgan Engineering & Surveying Recklessly created a conflicting surveys of Lot 3 of Block 202 that resulted in significant financial damanges as it perpetuated the title dispute.</p>  
    
    <p>The fabricated survey appears to be create with the specific intenton to terminate the boundary dispute. The survey has numerious errors and 
	   conflicting statements which the surveyor refused to update.  This survey contributed to the financial damanges in legal fees, damages to title, 
	   and Development opportunity Cost of the defendants.</p>           
    <ul>       
        <li>The survey of Lot 3 in Block 202 does not calculate up to 50'</li>   
        <li>The survey states that no encroachment exist</li>
		<li>The survey calls out the POB as existing nail in middle of the two property but the nail is not in between the property lines</li>    		
        <li>The suryey appeared to be created at the behest of the Adam Steuerman & Joe Carannante for the sole purpose to terminate the ligation 
		to conceal the numerious errors of their existing survey.</li> 
		<li>The survey does not reference any existing survey.</li>
		<li>The survey appeared to be use the same control point as the Stanely Hans as the survey circles all the control points with yellow chalk pen</li>
