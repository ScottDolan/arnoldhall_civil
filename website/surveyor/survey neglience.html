    From 110 year (1906-2016), there were zero discrepancy regarding the boundary line between property 
    owners of Lot 2 and Lot 3 of Block 202 of Point Pleasant of Beach. During that time, we currently know
    of 5 different surveys that all indicated the building on Lot 3 encroaches Lot 2.  
    Those surveys were commissioned by multiple parties including both property owners and 
    multiple potential buyers of both properties.  The surveys were performed by various different 
    Surveyors for various different parties and reasons.   Exhibits:
